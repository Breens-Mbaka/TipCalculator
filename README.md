I used view binding to create one view biniding object that I can use to refer to Views which have IDs.
I was able to build my UI widgets using the Material Design Componets library for example the "inputEditText".
I applied one common material design style to the UI widgets created like the "RadioButton","TextView" and "Switch button".
